Question 10

	You can merge two or more table cells in a column using the colspan attribute in a <td> HTML tag (table data). To merge two or more row cells, use the rowspan attribute. 

How to use colspan attribute :

	If we wanted to combine the first two cells in the first column, we could use the colspan="2" attribute in the first <td> tag. The number represents how many cells to use (merge) for the <td> tag, the first cell spans the width of two columns.

How to use rowspan attribute :

	If we wanted to combine the first two cells in the first column into one cell, we could use the rowspan="2" attribute in the first <td> tag. The number represents how many cells to use for the <td> tag, the first cell spans the height of two rows.

Using "0" as the number in colspan and rowspan :

	All modern browsers treat a "0" (zero) in the colspan and rowspan as the maximum rows or columns. For example, instead of counting a table's rows, use rowspan="0" to expand the row to the end of the table.Using "0" is helpful for big tables and for dynamic tables where the number of rows and columns may change frequently.
