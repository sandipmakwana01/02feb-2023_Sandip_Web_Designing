Question 11

Hyperlinks are a set of anchor tags that are used to point to another HTML file, text, audio, video, webpage, etc. Basically, a hyperlink is what makes a web.

	Let's take an example of a popular webpage Wikipedia. As soon as we click on some of the hyperlinks present in the Wikipedia webpage, it redirects us to another specified webpage.

	Hyperlinks allow us to link the documents to other documents as well as a link to specific parts of a document. Almost any content on the web can be converted to a link that when clicked goes to another webpage.

HTML Links - Syntax :

The anchor tag <a>..</a> is used to define a hyperlink in HTML. The syntax to specify the links in HTML is as follows 

<a href=""> Text </a>

The href attribute is the most important attribute of the anchor tag as it contains the link to the destination.

The Text in the syntax is the text that is visible to the user as a link that when clicked takes the user to the destination webpage.

Clicking on the text "Go to Google.com" takes us to Googleâ€™s home page which is linked in the href attribute inside the anchor tags.

The Target Attribute :

	The target attribute in HTML is used to tell the browser where to open the linked document when the link is clicked. However, by default, the linked documents open up in the current browser window but if you want to open it in another browser window or somewhere else then you need to specify the target attribute.
