    <h1>Question 10 : Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h1>
    <p>
        Background and color should be used as separate properties in HTML because they refer to different aspects of the appearance of an element.
<br><br>
The color property refers to the color of the text content within an element, while the background-color property refers to the color of the background behind the text. Using separate properties allows you to define different colors for the text and background, which can improve the readability and aesthetics of your web page.

        This text is white on a black background.
