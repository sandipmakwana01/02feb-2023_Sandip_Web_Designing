    <h1>Question 2 : What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h1>
    <p>
        Browser compatibility issues :- 
        <br><br>
        Different browsers may interpret CSS code differently, which can lead to display inconsistencies across different platforms. Designers may need to spend additional time testing and adjusting their styles to ensure compatibility across all major browsers.
<br><br>
        Steep learning curve:- 
        <br><br>
        CSS can have a steep learning curve for beginners, especially when trying to learn advanced techniques or solve complex layout problems. This can lead to frustration and slower development times.
    <br><br>
        Dependence on HTML structure:- 
        <br><br>
        CSS is dependent on the structure of the HTML document it is applied to. If the HTML structure is poorly organized or changes frequently, it can make it difficult to maintain or update the CSS styles.
    <br><br>
        Overuse of CSS frameworks:- 
        <br><br>
        While CSS frameworks can be useful for streamlining the design process, overuse can lead to a website looking generic and lacking in originality. This can also lead to slower load times if the framework includes unnecessary code.
    <br><br>
        Limited design control:- 
        <br><br>
        While CSS provides a wide range of design tools and techniques, there may be certain design elements or effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve using CSS alone. In some cases, designers may need to use other technologies, such as JavaScript or SVG, to achieve the desired effect.
    <br><br>
        Performance issues:- 
        <br><br>
        While CSS can improve performance by reducing page load times, poorly optimized CSS can also slow down a website. Large CSS files or complex styles can take longer to load, which can lead to a slower user experience.
