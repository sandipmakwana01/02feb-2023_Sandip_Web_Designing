    <h1>Question 16 : What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h1>
    <p>
        External style sheets in HTML have several advantages and disadvantages.
<br><br>
Advantages:
<br><br>
    Consistency: External style sheets allow you to define styles once and apply them to multiple web pages, which helps to maintain a consistent look and feel across the entire website. <br>
    Maintenance: By using external style sheets, you can separate the presentation of the website from its content, making it easier to maintain and update the design of the website. <br>
    Bandwidth: External style sheets are cached by the browser, which means that once a user visits a website, the style sheet is stored in their cache. This results in faster load times for subsequent visits to the same website. <br>
    Accessibility: External style sheets can be used to make websites more accessible by separating the presentation of the content from the HTML structure. This allows users with disabilities to better navigate and understand the content.
<br><br>
Disadvantages:
<br><br>
    Additional HTTP request: Using external style sheets requires an additional HTTP request to retrieve the style sheet, which can slow down the loading time of the web page. <br>
    Dependency: External style sheets are dependent on the availability and correct path of the linked file. If the style sheet file is moved or deleted, the linked web page will not be able to retrieve the styles. <br>
    Security: External style sheets can be vulnerable to security issues if they are not properly secured or if they contain malicious code. <br>
    Learning curve: Using external style sheets requires an understanding of CSS syntax and selectors, which may require additional time and effort to learn for those who are new to web development. <br>
