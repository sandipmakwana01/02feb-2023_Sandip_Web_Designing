    <h1>Question 1 : What are the benefits of using CSS?</h1>
    <p>
        Easier maintenance :-
        <br><br>
        By using CSS to separate presentation from content, web designers can make it easier to maintain and update a website. Changes to the visual style of a site can be made by updating the CSS file, without having to change the underlying HTML code.
        <br><br>
        Flexibility :-
        <br><br>
         CSS offers a wide range of tools and techniques for controlling the layout and visual style of web pages. This allows designers to create unique and visually appealing designs, and to experiment with different layouts and styles to find the best fit for their content.
         <br><br>
         SEO benefits :- 
         <br><br>
         Using CSS can also have SEO (Search Engine Optimization) benefits. By separating content from presentation, it makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index the content on a website. Additionally, well-structured HTML and CSS can improve the website's readability and load time, which can boost its search engine rankings.
         <br><br>
         Better user experience :- 
         <br><br>
         Finally, using CSS can improve the overall user experience of a website. By creating a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate site, visitors are more likely to engage with the content and stay on the site longer. This can lead to higher conversion rates and improved customer satisfaction.
         <br><br>
         Modularity :- 
         <br><br>
         CSS allows designers to create reusable styles and components, making it easier to maintain and update a website over time. By separating styles into modular components, designers can quickly make changes across the entire site without having to go through each page one-by-one.
         <br><br>
         Responsive design :- 
         <br><br>
         With the growing number of mobile devices, responsive design has become more important than ever. CSS offers several tools for creating responsive designs, allowing websites to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
        <br><br>
Animation and interactivity :- 
<br><br>
CSS can also be used to create animations and interactivity on web pages. This can include things like hover effects, transitions, and animations. These effects can make the website more engaging and interesting, leading to higher user engagement and conversion rates.
