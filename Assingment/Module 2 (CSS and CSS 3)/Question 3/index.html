    <h1>Question 3 : What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3? </h1>
    <p>
        Selectors: <br><br> CSS3 introduces several new selectors that provide more flexible ways to target specific elements in a document. For example, the attribute selector allows designers to select elements based on the value of an attribute, while the :nth-child selector allows designers to select elements based on their position in a parent element.
<br><br>
        Box Model: <br><br> CSS3 introduces the box-sizing property, which allows designers to control how the size of an element is calculated. This can be used to ensure that padding and borders are included in the size of an element, making it easier to create consistent layouts.
    <br><br>
        Backgrounds and Borders: <br><br> CSS3 introduces several new properties for controlling the appearance of backgrounds and borders, including border-radius, box-shadow, and background-size. These properties provide more control over the way elements are displayed on a web page.
    <br><br>
        Text Effects: <br><br> CSS3 introduces several new properties for controlling the appearance of text, including text-shadow, text-overflow, and word-wrap. These properties provide more control over the way text is displayed on a web page.
    <br><br>
        Transitions and Animations: <br><br> CSS3 introduces several new properties for creating transitions and animations, including transition, transform, and animation. These properties allow designers to create more dynamic and engaging web experiences.
    <br><br>
        Media Queries: <br><br> CSS3 introduces media queries, which allow designers to create styles that are specific to different devices or screen sizes. This can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to the needs of different users.
