    <h1>Question 11 :  What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h1>
    <p>
        -> The inline and block elements of HTML are one of the important areas where web developers often get confused because they were unable to know which are inline and block elements which may cause clumsiness in a webpage in case he assumes some element to be a block but it is an inline element which causes next element comes next to it.
<br><br>
Block elements :-
<br>
-> They consume the entire width available irrespective of their sufficiency.
<br>
-> They always start in a new line and have top and bottom margins.
<br>
->  It does not contain any other elements next to it.
<br><br>
Inline elements :-
<br>
-> Inline elements occupy only enough width that is sufficient to it and allows other elements next to it which are inline.
<br>
->  Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and bottom margins as block elements have.
<br>
Example  of the difference between block-level and inline elements:
<br>
<div >This is a block-level element.</div>
<span>This is an inline element.</span>


    </p>
