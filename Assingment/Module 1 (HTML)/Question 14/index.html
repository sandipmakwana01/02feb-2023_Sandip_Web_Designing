    <h1>Question 14 :  What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</h1>
    <p>-> The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. 
<br>
        ->  It is used to group elements for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes), A better way to use it when no other semantic element is available.
        <br>
        -> The span tag is a paired tag means it has both open(<) and closing (>) tags, and it is mandatory to close the tag.
        <br>
        -> The span tag is used for the grouping of inline elements & this tag does not make any visual change by itself.
        <br>
        -> span is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag.
