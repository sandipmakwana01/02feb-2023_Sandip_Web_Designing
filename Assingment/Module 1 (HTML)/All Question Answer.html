   <h1>Question 1 : Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h1>
   <p>
    HTML Tages :-
    <br>
    -> HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content.
    <br>

    <tagname> Content goes here.... </tagname>
    <br>
    -> Some HTML element have no content ( like the <br> element). These element are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

<br>
-> HTML provides some Entity names and Entity numbers to use these symbols.
<br>
-> Entity names are case-sensitive.

Block elements :-

->  Inline elements don’t start from a new line and don’t have top and bottom margins as block elements have.
<br>

-> The <a> tag is supported in almost all browsers.
<br><br>
Active Link :-
