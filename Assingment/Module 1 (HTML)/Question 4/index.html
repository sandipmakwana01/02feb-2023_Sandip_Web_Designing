    <h1>Question 4 : What are HTML Entities?</h1>
    <p>
        HTML Entities :-
<br>
-> HTML provides some method to display reserved characters.
<br>
-> Reserved characters are those characters that are either reserved for HTML or those which are not present in the basic keyboard.
<br>
-> For instance, ‘<‘ is reserved in HTML language.
<br>
-> Sometimes this character needs to display on the web page which creates ambiguity in code.
<br>
-> Along with these are the characters which are normally not present in basic keyboard ( £, ¥, €, © ), etc.
<br>
-> HTML provides some Entity names and Entity numbers to use these symbols.
<br>
-> Entity names are case-sensitive.
<br>
-> Entity number is easy to learn.
<br>

<p>This is an example of using HTML entities to display special characters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt; - less than</li>
  <li>&gt; - greater than</li>
  <li>&amp; - ampersand</li>
  <li>&quot; - double quotation mark</li>
  <li>&apos; - single quotation mark</li>
</ul>
