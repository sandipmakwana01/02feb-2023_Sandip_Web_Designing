    <h1>Question 16 :  How are active links different from normal links? </h1>
    <p>
        
Normal links (Unvisited links) :-
<br>
-> If you want to create a link to go to “https://www.google.com/“, you can get the normal link through this code.
<br>
-> The default color is blue color and underlined but you can apply your own custom styling according to the application’s need.
<br>
-> The <a> tag is supported in almost all browsers.
<br><br>
Active Link :-
<br>
-> If you left or right-click any one of the links Visited or Unvisited, it will turn into Red and Underline. 
<br>
-> Active Links shows that the browser is in the process to load a new resource.  
<br>
-> You can do your own custom styling using CSS :active selector. In the above output, notice the active link on right-click of the link.
