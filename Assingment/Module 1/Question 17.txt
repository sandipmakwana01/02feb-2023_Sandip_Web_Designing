Question 17

	There are three tags used to separate the text. i.e. usually <br> tag is used to separate line of texts. Other tags are <p> tag and <blockquote> tag.

1. <br> Tag :
	
	The <br> tag in HTML document is used to create a line break in a text.It is generally used in poem or address where the division of line is necessary. It is an empty tag, which means it does not need a company of end tag. If you place the <br> tag in the HTML code, then it works the same as pressing the enter key in a word processor.

Note : Don't use br tag for the margin between two paragraphs, use CSS margin property instead.

2. <p> Tag :

	HTML paragraph  or HTML p tag is used to define a paragreph in a webpage. Let's take a simple example to see how it work. It is a notable point that a browser itself add aan empty line before and after a paragraph. An HTML <p> tag indicates starting of new paragraph.

Note : If we are using various <p> tags in one HTML file then browser automatically adds a single blank line between the two paragraphs.

3. <Blockquote> Tag :

	HTML <blockquote> tag is used to define a block of text which is quoted from another source. The Browser usually displays the content within <blockquote> tag as indented text.If you want to insert a long quote then use <blockquote> and for short or inline quote use <q> tag.
