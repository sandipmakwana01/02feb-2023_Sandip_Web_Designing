Question 16

	Websites are designed to point you to different resources. You can move from one website to another through links. Links help you to get information from different resources. Links are established in simple HTML web pages through <a> tag.

	The default color for normal and active links is blue. Some browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is placed over that link; others recognize active links when the link has the focus. Those that donâ€™t have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link.

Links are categorized into three types. Typically a Link is displayed in three different colors based on the usage.

1. Normal links (Unvisited links)
2. Visited links
3. Active links
