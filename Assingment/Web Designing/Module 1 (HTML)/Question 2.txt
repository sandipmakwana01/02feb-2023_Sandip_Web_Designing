Question 2
----------

-> HTML tags are what defines where an HTML element starts and where it ends. 

->There is usually an opening bracket followed by the elementâ€™s name and, finally, a closing bracket.

->In most cases, there is always a start tag and an end tag enclosing an element.

->Nevertheless, that is not the case for all elements.

->As far as HTML is concerned, there are several types of a tag. 

->The first one is the start tag. 

->It contains two opposite angle brackets. 

Examples include:
-----------------

<title>
<p>
<b>
The other one is the end tag. The similarity to the start tag, it has angle brackets. However, there is a forward slash after the first angle bracket. Examples of the end tags corresponding to the start tags above are as follows.
</title>
</p>
</b>

-> In simple words, an HTML attribute is what modifies an HTML element. 

-> It is usually in the form of unique words that one inserts inside the opening tag. 

->They control the behavior of the element that follows.

->Every tag has two sections. 
The first one is usually the name of the attribute, while the other one is its value. 

->The two are usually separated by an equals sign (=). 

->Attributes are inside the start tag of that particular element that needs modification.

<element attribute="value">element content</element>
