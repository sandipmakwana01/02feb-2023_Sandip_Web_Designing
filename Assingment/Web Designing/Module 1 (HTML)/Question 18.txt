Question 18

A Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) is a unique type of image format. Unlike other varieties, SVGs don’t rely on unique pixels to make up the images you see. Instead, they use ‘vector’ data.

By using SVGs, you get images that can scale up to any resolution, which comes in handy for web design among plenty of other use cases.
